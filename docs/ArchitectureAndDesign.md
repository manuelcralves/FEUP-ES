## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture
High-level logical structure of the code (Logical View), using a UML diagram with logical packages.

### Physical architecture
Document the high-level physical structure of the software system using UML deployment diagrams showing the physical structure of the system.

### Vertical prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe which feature you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a feature that demonstrates thay you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).
